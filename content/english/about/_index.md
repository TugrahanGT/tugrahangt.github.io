triple-ID was born as the paths of experienced IAM Consultants have crossed and they decided to combine their forces to create the perfect Identity and Access Management consulting company. Each of the initial team members has extensive knowledge on multiple IAM Products including Omada Identity, Oracle Identity Manager, OneIdentity and SailPoint. They worked in projects across Europe with customers from diverse industries like finance, automotive, healthcare and government institutions.

On top of that, we have experience working on the vendor side, as an implementation partner as well as customer side. Being able to think like a customer, act like a value driven partner and deliver as a vendor, we believe we are a match for any customer that needs help in their IAM journey.

Last but not least, we have also been there, where you as a customer are now, responsible for the integration and maintenance of a product touching almost every system of your company infrastructure. At which point, you would look for the right partner, someone you can trust and who can guide you in the right direction. With the only difference that back then triple-ID didn’t exist, yet!

As triple-ID, an international company, with strong teams in the Netherlands and Turkey, our mission is pretty much straightforward: to enable your organization to focus on your core business, while we take care of your IAM journey with measurable, secure, compliant and efficient processes.
